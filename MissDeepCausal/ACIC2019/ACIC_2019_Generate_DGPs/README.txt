ACIC_2019_Generate_DGPs is a zip file containing R code for generating the datasets for the ACIC 2019 Data Challenge.  The code is in four separate directories, according to track and originator of the DGP.

1. GL_Generate_High_Dim_Cont contains information for generating high dimensional datawith continuous outcomes.  Covariates for these DGPs were simulated. If you have questions about these files or DGPs, contact Genevi√®ve LeFebvre, lefebvre.gen@uqam.ca.

2. SG_Generate_High_Dim_Binary contains code for generating high dimensional data with binary outcomes. Covariates were taken from publicly available datasets. URLs are provided within comments in the R files. If you have questions about these files or DGPs, contact Susan Gruber, sgruber@putnamds.com

3. SG_Generate_Low_Dim contains code for generating low dimensional data. Covariates were taken from publicly available datasets. URLs are provided within comments in the R files. If you have questions about these files or DGPs, contact Susan Gruber, sgruber@putnamds.com

4. TS_Generate_Low_Dim  contains code for generating low dimensional data with binary or continuous outcomes. Covariates were taken from publicly available datasets. URLs are provided within comments in the R files. If you have questions about these files or DGPs, contact Tibor Shuster, tibor.schuster@mcgill.ca
